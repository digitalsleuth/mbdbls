# mbdbls
Parse Manifest.mbdb files from iTunes backup directories

This updated code is based on the modifications by Hal Pomeranz (github.com/halpomeranz), and the original code found here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3085153/how-to-parse-the-manifest-mbdb-file-in-an-ios-4-0-itunes-backup

Since this tool still has some relevance for open-source forensics, and Python 2 is no longer supported, I figured it was time to update it for Python 3.
